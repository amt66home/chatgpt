To connect to an Azure SQL Managed Instance using a system-assigned managed identity from an Azure API, you typically use the Azure Managed Identity feature for authentication. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. **Enable Managed Identity for the Azure API:**
   - In the Azure portal, go to your Azure API's resource page.
   - Under the "Settings" section, select "Identity."
   - Enable the system-assigned managed identity if it's not already enabled.

2. **Grant Managed Identity Access to Managed Instance:**
   - In your Azure SQL Managed Instance, navigate to "Firewalls and virtual networks."
   - Allow the managed identity's system-assigned identity's service principal to access the SQL Managed Instance. You can do this by adding the managed identity's object ID as a user or a contained database user, depending on your needs.

3. **Use Managed Identity in Your API:**
   In your Azure API code, you need to acquire a token from Azure AD using the managed identity, and then use that token for authentication when connecting to the Azure SQL Managed Instance.

   Here is an example using Python and the `msal` library to obtain a token:

   ```python
   from msal import PublicClientApplication
   import pyodbc

   managed_instance_name = "your-managed-instance-name"
   database_name = "your-database-name"
   
   # Create an instance of the PublicClientApplication class
   pca = PublicClientApplication(None, authority="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common")

   # Acquire a token using managed identity
   accounts = pca.get_accounts(username=None)
   result = pca.acquire_token_silent(["https://database.windows.net/.default"], account=accounts[0])

   # Use the acquired token in the connection string
   access_token = result["access_token"]
   conn_str = (
       f"Driver=ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server;"
       f"Server={managed_instance_name}.database.windows.net;"
       f"Database={database_name};"
       f"Authentication=ActiveDirectoryManagedIdentity;"
       f"AccessToken={access_token};"
   )

   # Connect to the Azure SQL Managed Instance using pyodbc
   with pyodbc.connect(conn_str) as conn:
       cursor = conn.cursor()
       cursor.execute("SELECT TOP 10 * FROM YourTable")
       rows = cursor.fetchall()
       for row in rows:
           print(row)
   ```

   Make sure to replace `"your-managed-instance-name"` and `"your-database-name"` with your actual managed instance name and database name.

4. **Run Your Azure API:**
   Deploy and run your Azure API, and it will use the system-assigned managed identity's credentials to authenticate and connect to the Azure SQL Managed Instance.

Remember to have the necessary libraries (like `msal` for token acquisition and `pyodbc` for SQL connection) referenced in your project, and ensure that your managed identity has the required permissions to access the Azure SQL Managed Instance.

This example is in Python, but you can adapt the concept to other programming languages as needed.
